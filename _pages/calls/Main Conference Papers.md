## Overview
The 11th International Hybrid Conference on Big Data Analytics and Artificial
Intelligence(BDA 2023) will be held during December 07-09, 2023. The conference will be
organized by Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIITD), India. BDA 2023
provides an international forum for researchers and industry practitioners to share their
original research results, practical experiences and thoughts on big data and AI. The topics
are from different perspectives, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, storage
models, data access, computing paradigms, analytics, information sharing and privacy,
redesigning mining algorithms, and future research trends.

BDA 2023 invites original, technically sound, high-quality research papers proposing novel
solutions addressing the problems related to big data analytics and AI as well as case
studies and practical experiences with big data and artificial intelligence. Major topics of
interest to the conference include, but are not limited to:


## Research Track Submissions:

Each paper should contain an abstract of approximately 300 words having a page limit of 20
pages in the LNCS style. The  submissions include the title page, references, and appendix.
For preparing the manuscript, please see instructions for authors by Springer, in the Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series (LNCS). The BDA proceedings is expected to be
published by Springer's LNCS series (approval pending).


BDA 2023 has the goal of a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas: 

- Analytics as a Service
- Architectural Design for Big Data
- Big Data Analytics for Governance
- Conceptual/cognitive/programming Models for Big data analytics
- Clustering of Big Data
- Data Fusion and Multi Modal Analytics
- Data Models for Big Data Analytics
- Domain-specific Analytics
- Index Structures for Big Data Analytics
- Interaction Design for Exploratory Analytics
- Machine Learning and AI techniques for Big Data
- Large-scale recommendation systems and graph analysis
- Model Discovery from Big Data
- NoSQL and non-standard Data Models
- Physical Data Organization for Big Data
- Predictive Modelling
- Rule Mining from Big Data
- Scalability and Performance issues
- Security, privacy and legal issues specific to big data
- Semantics of Big Data
- Streaming Data Analytics
- Summarization and Materialized views
- Topic Modelling
- Unstructured and Semi-structured Data Mining
- Visual analytics


### Review Process:
Papers submitted to BDA23 will have the “regular” review process: paper reviewed by 3 reviewers. Authors will be advised to revise their paper before the camera ready deadline, if accepted.

Papers submitted to BDA 2023 **may not be submitted for review elsewhere** while being under review at BDA 2023.

## Workshops and Tutorials: 
The BDA 2023 organizing committee invites proposals for half-day
and full-day workshops and tutorials on established and emerging topics in Big Data
Analytics and other related areas. Information for submitting each type of proposal is provided on the conference website. Visit [https://bda23.iiitd.edu.in] for the details of call for WORKSHOP and TUTORIAL proposals.
